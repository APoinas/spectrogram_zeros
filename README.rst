Python code accompanying the paper `On two fundamental properties of the zeros of
spectrograms of noisy signals <??????????????>`_ with 
`RÃ©mi Bardenet <https://rbardenet.github.io/>`_.

The file "Signal.py" contains the function "MLEDPP" computing the asymptotic approximation of the MLE
of common parametric families of stationnary DPPs and the function "Fisher_Info" computing the associated Fisher information matrix. The file "Estimator Comparison.R" gives examples
of utilisation of the function "MLEDPP" as well as a way to reproduce the results of out paper. The file "Fisher IC.R" does the same for the function "Fisher_info".

Instructions for the function MLEDPP
------------------------------------

Syntax
~~~~~~

The full syntax of the MLEDPP function is the following

MLEDPP = function(ppp, DPPfamily, startpar=NULL, sigma=NULL, edgecorr=FALSE, Trunc=50)

The main arguments are:

- ppp -> The observed point pattern, an object of class "ppp".
- DPPfamily -> The DPP family that is fitted to the data, it has to be either "Gauss", "Bessel", "Cauchy" or "Whittle-Matern".

The additional arguments are:

- startpar -> Optional. Initial value of alpha used in the optimization procedure. By default it is alpha_max/2 where alpha_max is the highest value of alpha for which the DPP is well-defined.
- sigma -> Must be specified for "Whittle-Matern" families only. The shape parametric of the family (called nu in `dppMatern <https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.core/man/dppMatern.html>`__)
- edgecorr -> Logical. If 'TRUE' and the observation window is rectangular, it computes the periodic edge correction. If 'TRUE' and the observation window isn't rectangular, it computes the experimental edge correction described in Section 5.3 of our paper.
- Trunc -> Optional. Maximum truncation used for the computation of L_0 for all DPP families except Bessel.

The function returns an object of class "detpointprocfamily" corresponding to the DPP family fitted
on the observed point pattern by the asymptotic approximation of the maximum likelihood estimator.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the approximated MLE is coded for stationnary DPPs on any window of R^2 with either a Gaussian-type kernel, a Bessel-type kernel with sigma=0, a Cauchy-type kernel with nu=1/2 or a Whittle-Matern-type kernel with a fixed shape parameter.

Instructions for the function Fisher_Info
-----------------------------------------

Syntax
~~~~~~

The full syntax of the Fisher_Info function is the following

Fisher_Info = function(ppp, DPPfamily, alpha_est, edgecorr=FALSE, Max_Trunc=50)

The main arguments are:

- ppp -> The observed point pattern, an object of class "ppp".
- DPPfamily -> The DPP family that is fitted to the data, it has to be either "Gauss", "Bessel" or "Cauchy".
- alpha_est -> The estimator of alpha obtained by maximum likelihood estimation.

The additional arguments are:

- edgecorr -> Logical. If 'TRUE' and the observation window is rectangular, it computes the periodic edge correction. If 'TRUE' and the observation window isn't rectangular, it computes the experimental edge correction described in Section 5.3 of our paper.
- Max_Trunc -> Optional. Maximum truncation used for the computation of L_0 for all DPP families except Bessel.

The function returns a 2x2 matrix corresponding to the Fisher Information matrix for the parameters (rho, alpha) of classical stationnary DPP families.
